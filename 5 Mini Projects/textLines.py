seems to be of a shinier material than the last room. Bookshelves line the room, making it feel almost claustrophobic.

The floor is littered with what seem to be sheets of paper and various books that seem to have come from the bookshelf,
including one really big book. You pick one of the books up only to realize the writing is in a language you do not recognize...
